# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting passenger survival on the RMS Titanic using classic machine learning techniques.

This project is organized as a notebook-driven workflow. Use the notebook(s) in `NoteBook/` to explore, clean, and model the data placed in `DataSet/`. The goal is to build a reproducible baseline and leave clear hooks for future improvements.
